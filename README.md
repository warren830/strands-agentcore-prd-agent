# Strands AgentCore PRD Agent

An English-first Product Requirements Document generator built with the Strands Agents SDK, Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

## What it does

- Normalizes product requirements into typed intake contracts.
- Retrieves product and repository evidence exclusively through an AgentCore Managed Knowledge Base exposed by an AWS_IAM-authenticated AgentCore Gateway.
- Generates an English PRD with Strands and `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1`.
- Renders Markdown deterministically against a versioned PRD Contract.
- Fails closed on missing sections, structural drift, invalid citations, stale source snapshots, or unknown code paths and symbols.
- Streams `started`, periodic `progress`, final `result`, and sanitized `error` SSE envelopes from AgentCore Runtime.

## Architecture

```text
Client
  -> AgentCore Runtime
     -> Strands requirement analyzer
     -> AgentCore Gateway (AWS_IAM / SigV4)
        -> AgentCore Managed Knowledge Base
     -> Strands PRD composer (Claude Opus 4.6)
     -> deterministic Contract validation and bounded repair
     -> SSE result + validation report
```

AgentCore Managed Knowledge Base is the sole retrieval layer. Source code is ingested through a deterministic manifest and immutable snapshot so generated code impacts cannot refer to stale or unknown repository content.

## Project structure

- `app.py` — AgentCore Runtime entrypoint.
- `src/prd_agent/` — contracts, workflow, Strands adapters, retrieval, validation, rendering, authentication, and deployment configuration.
- `contracts/` — versioned machine-readable PRD Contract.
- `examples/` — non-authoritative mock PRD fixture.
- `scripts/` — account-locked isolated test-stack provisioner and Gateway smoke tools.
- `tests/` — unit and regression tests.
- `deploy/evidence/cloud-e2e-007/` — saved output and validation evidence from the successful mock cloud E2E run.

## Local validation

Python 3.12 is required. Dependencies are pinned exactly.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -q
```

Current result: **120 tests passing**.

## Cloud E2E result

The isolated mock deployment completed a genuine end-to-end invocation in AWS account `034362076319`, `us-east-1`:

- HTTP 200 with `text/event-stream`.
- Final event: `result`; business status: `completed`.
- 24/24 required PRD sections and exact H3/table signatures verified.
- Validation report passed with no remaining issues.
- Citations were restricted to chunks returned by the Managed Knowledge Base.
- Runtime, prompt, Contract, ingestion, repository snapshot, and model versions were pinned in the result.

See [`deploy/evidence/cloud-e2e-007/README.md`](deploy/evidence/cloud-e2e-007/README.md) for the evidence summary and hashes. The fixture and generated PRD are explicitly mock and non-authoritative.

## Deployment safety

The provisioner is account-locked and uses isolated `prd-agent-mock-e2e` names. Review its dry-run before applying it to an AWS account. It does not contain resource deletion operations, and no cleanup should be performed without explicit authorization.
